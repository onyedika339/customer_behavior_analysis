# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
## 1. Project Overview
This project analyses customer shopping behavior using transactional data from 3,900 purchases across multiple product categories.
The goal is to identify trends in customer demographics, spending patterns, discount usage, product preferences, and subscription behavior to support data-driven business decisions.

This end-to-end project covers:
Python → EDA → Data Cleaning → SQL (Postgre) → KPI Analysis → Power BI Dashboard → Business Recommendations

## 2. Dataset Summary
Rows: 3,900
Columns: 18
Key Features Include:
Customer demographics: gender, age, age group, location, subscription status

Purchase details: item purchased, category, purchase amount, season, size, color

Shopping behavior: discount applied, promo code used, previous purchases, purchase frequency

Product feedback: review rating

Logistics: shipping type

Missing Data: 37 missing values found in review_rating

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Initial data preparation and cleaning were executed in Python using pandas.

Key Steps
✔ Data Loading & Initial Exploration
Loaded CSV into a pandas DataFrame
Used df.info() and df.describe() to understand dataset structure and distributions
✔ Handling Missing Data
Checked for null values in all columns
Imputed missing review_rating values using median rating by product category
✔ Column Standardisation
Renamed all columns to snake_case for readability and consistency
✔ Feature Engineering
Created age_group by binning customer ages
Generated purchase_frequency_days using purchase timestamps
Verified redundancy between discount_applied and promo_code_used
Dropped promo_code_used due to overlap
✔ Database Integration
Connected Python to MySQL
Loaded the cleaned DataFrame into MySQL for structured analytical querying
## 4. Data Analysis using SQL (MySQL)
A series of structured SQL queries were run to answer core business questions, including:

Revenue by Gender – Total revenue comparison between male and female customers
High-Spending Discount Users – Identified customers who applied discounts yet exceeded average spend
Top 5 Products by Review Rating
Shipping Comparison – Average purchase amounts for Standard vs. Express shipping
Subscribers vs. Non-Subscribers – Revenue and average spend by subscription status
Discount-Dependent Products – Top 5 items with highest discount usage rate
Customer Segmentation – Classified customers into New, Returning, and Loyal
Top 3 Products per Category – Identified using window functions
Repeat Buyers & Subscription Likelihood – Subscription patterns among customers with >5 purchases
Revenue by Age Group – Identified high-value customer segments
These MySQL queries validated insights discovered during Python EDA and added more focused business intelligence.

## 5. Dashboard in Power BI
The interactive Power BI dashboard includes:

Key KPIs (Total Revenue, AOV, Discount Usage %)
Revenue by age group, gender, and product category
Customer segmentation analysis
Product performance and review ratings
Shipping trends
Discount usage behaviour
The dashboard is designed to be simple, intuitive, and stakeholder-friendly.

## 6. Key Insights
Customers aged 25–34 generate the highest revenue
Discount usage has a strong positive effect on purchase amount
Express shipping customers tend to spend more
Several high-selling products have below-average review ratings
Loyal customers contribute significantly to lifetime revenue
Subscribers show higher average order value than non-subscribers
## 7. Business Recommendations
✔ Boost Subscriptions
Introduce exclusive perks to encourage customers to subscribe.

✔ Customer Loyalty Program
Reward returning customers to increase the number of Loyal customers.

✔ Refine Discount Strategy
Use discounts strategically to boost conversions without hurting margins.

✔ Improve Low-Rated High-Demand Products
Investigate issues with heavily purchased but poorly rated items.

✔ Targeted Marketing Campaigns
Focus efforts on:

Age group 25–34
Express shipping users
Loyal customers
## 8. Business Impact
If implemented, these recommendations could lead to:

Increased customer retention
Higher subscription rates
More effective marketing strategies
Improved product quality
Stronger long-term revenue growth
